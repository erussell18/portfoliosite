                <p>I am a senior at Saint Peterâ€™s university majoring in Computer Science Information Systems. I love problem solving and creating things which lead me to web development. Over the past four years I have been working in I.T while going to school but I am looking to transition into a web developer after I graduate. This site was created because my old portfolio website did not look as professional as I would have liked it to, so I used a fresh design that makes the site feel open and not so cluttered. In the future I might create another portfolio website when I gain more experience but for now this is the site that I will be updating with my projects.
